Artificial Intelligence (AI): Simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems.
​Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
​Dataset: A collection of data used to train or test a machine learning model.
​Features: The input variables (columns) used to make predictions (e.g., "Square Footage" in a house price model).
​Labels (Target): The output variable you are trying to predict (e.g., "Price" in a house price model).
​Supervised Learning: Training a model on labeled data (input-output pairs are known).
​Unsupervised Learning: finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
​Overfitting: When a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise, and fails on new data.
​Underfitting: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
​Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
​Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
​Training Set: The subset of data used to train the model.
​Test Set: The subset of data kept hidden to evaluate how well the model performs.
​Regression: A type of ML problem where the output is a continuous number (e.g., predicting temperature).
​Classification: A type of ML problem where the output is a category (e.g., Is this email Spam or Not Spam?).
